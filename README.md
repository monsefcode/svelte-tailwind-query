# svelte-tailwind-query

A comprehensive starter project combining Svelte, Tailwind CSS, and Svelte Query, providing a solid foundation for building dynamic and responsive web applications.

## Features

- **Svelte**: A lightweight and reactive frontend framework for building user interfaces.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development.
- **Svelte Query**: A powerful server state management and data fetching library for Svelte.

## Getting Started

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) installed globally on your machine.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory using your terminal.
3. Run the following command to install the dependencies:

```shell
pnpm install
```

## Development

To start the development server and see your app in action, use the following command:

```shell
pnpm dev
```

This will compile the Svelte components, bundle the JavaScript, and start a local development server at http://localhost:5000.

## Production

To build your app for production, use the following command:

```shell
pnpm build
```

This will create a `public` directory containing the minified and optimized assets ready for deployment.

## Customization

Feel free to customize this starter project to fit your specific needs. Some suggested modifications could be:

- Adding additional Svelte components in the `src/lib` directory.
- Adding API endpoints and modifying data fetching logic? add a `src/api` directory.
- Configuring your own Tailwind CSS theme in the `tailwind.config.js` file.
